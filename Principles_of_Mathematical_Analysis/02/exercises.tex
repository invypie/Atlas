\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that the empty set is a subset of every set.
    \item\label{exercise:2.2} A complex number \(z\) is said to be \emph{algebraic} if there are integers \(a_0\), \(\ldots\), \(a_n\), not all zero, such that
    \begin{equation*}
        a_0z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}z+a_n=0.
    \end{equation*}
    Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. \hint{For every positive integer \(N\) there are only finitely many equations with
    \begin{equation*}
        n+\abs[a_0]+\abs[a_1]+\cdots+\abs[a_n]=N.
    \end{equation*}
    }
\end{enumerate}
