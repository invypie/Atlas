\chapter{Survey of the Elementary Principles}

The motion of material bodies formed the subject of some of the earliest research pursued by the pioneers of physics. From their efforts there has evolved a vast field known as analytical mechanics or dynamics, or simply, mechanics. In the present century the term ``classical mechanics" has come into wide use to denote this branch of physics in contradistinction to the newer physical theories, especially quantum mechanics. We shall follow this usage, interpreting the name to include the type of mechanics arising out of the special theory of relativity. It is the purpose of this book to develop the structure of classical mechanics and to outline some of its applications of present-day interest in pure physics. Basic to any presentation of mechanics are a number of fundamental physical concepts, such as space, time, simultaneity, mass, and force. For the most part, however, these concepts will not be analyzed critically here; rather, they will be assumed as undefined terms whose meanings are familiar to the reader.
